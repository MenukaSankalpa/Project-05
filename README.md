# Project-05
A Grocery Store application in Python is a simple yet functional program designed to simulate the operations of a real-world grocery store. It helps users (customers or store managers) perform various tasks such as browsing available items, adding items to a shopping cart, removing items, checking the total price, and processing payments.
